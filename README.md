# README

## ðŸ’¬ Topics

I'm all about open source, writing, product marketing, developer relations, communications, and community. Also music, books, and cats if you want to talk about non-work things... 

Have been working in tech for more than 20 years, usually doing some combination of the above. 

## ðŸ“« Where to find me
- **Blog** [Dissociated Press](https://dissociatedpress.net/) for thoughts on all the above, music, and cats. 
- **Mastodon** as [@jzb@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@jzb) shorter thoughts... 
- [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zonker/) to connect professionally and elsewhere.
