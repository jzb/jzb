## ðŸ’¬ Topics

I'm all about [open source](https://dissociatedpress.net/tag/open-source/), [writing](https://dissociatedpress.net/category/writing/), product marketing, developer relations, communications, and community. Also [music](https://dissociatedpress.net/category/music/), [books](https://dissociatedpress.net/category/books/), and [cats](https://dissociatedpress.net/category/cats/) if you want to talk about non-work things. 

Have been [working in tech](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zonker/) for more than 20 years, usually doing some combination of the above.
